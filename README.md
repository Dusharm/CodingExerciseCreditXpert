# CodingExerciseCreditXpert
This was a coding assignment I did for CreditXperts during a job interview. They weren't very up front in the initial application about which technologies
they were hiring for  

## Langton's Ant
The Langton's ant implemntation was a basic CLI view implementation, Commented well and used to show I know a fundamentals of OOP. I experimented a little
bit with the array, attempting to make them dynamically sized depending on n


## Search Algorithm
There was a word problem that was a classic example of search problem. I flexed the data structure and algorithms knowledge.


## Conclusion
They never did contact me back after the second round interview. Don't know if that was Jobot or them. Overall they were nice people but were looking for a C#
.NET developer for building/maintaining APIs and the old code base, while the new stuff was being developed by others
